          <h2>Who is affected by non-recyclable plastic pollution?</h2>
          <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gbrionline.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2FCovanta-incinerator-in-Chester-Pennsylvania-788x445.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" height="250" alt="illustration">
          <p>In total, 4.4 million people live within three miles of an incinerator in the US. Of this total, 1.6 million live close to the top 12 incinerators measured in terms of pollutant emissions across a lead, particulate matter, mercury, and nitrous oxide.</p>
          <p>A total of 1.6 million Americans live next to the most polluting incinerators in the country, with lower-income and minority communities exposed to the vast majority of pollution coming from these waste-burning plants.</p>

          <h2>How are non-recycled plastics affecting communities?</h2>
          <p>These pollutants are linked to a range of health problems, including asthma and heart disease. US incinerators typically abide by rules set on the number of allowable emissions. But researchers said that even incinerators operating within their permits are adding to public health problems that heavily burden black, Hispanic, and poorer communities.</p>
          <h2>Effects of incineration</h2>
          <p>The burning of trash releases a host of pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides and particulate matter, which are tiny fragments of debris that, once inhaled, cause an array of health problems</p>
          <p>Some experts worry that burning plastic recycling will create a new fog of dioxins that will worsen an already alarming health situation in Chester. Nearly four in 10 children in the city have asthma, while the rate of ovarian cancer is 64% higher than the rest of Pennsylvania and lung cancer rates are 24% higher</p>
