              <li>In 2014, 25-percent of all of Philadelphia’s solid waste came from residential sources, while about 60-percent came from commercial businesses and 15-percent could be tracked back to construction and demolition sites. </li>
              <li>In 2014, 26-percent of Philadelphia’s solid waste going to landfills, and 28-percent was burned in incinerators to be converted into energy, while 46-percent was recycled.</li>
              <li>Although some argue residents recycle them to put trash or other items in, the city says only 1% of those bags are actually reused and usually end up on the streets. Plastic bags are the fifth most-littered item in the city, according to the city’s 2018 litter index. </li>
