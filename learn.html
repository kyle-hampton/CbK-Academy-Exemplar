          <p> Some of the factors that contribute to the high levels of non-recyclable range from careless disposal and separation of plastic as trash or waste, exporting, and to the price of recycling compared to making new plastics, just to name a few.</p>

          <p>There are a few ways to deal with waste and plastic</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Landfills which hold large amounts of trash and other Items to dispose over long periods of time, even hundreds of years.</li>
              <li>Incinerators burn trash and waste which then produce energy for people but pollutes the air.</li>
              <li>Recycling takes reusable materials such as some papers, plastics, cardboards, glass, and more for processing at a plant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Lack of separation of materials?</h2>
          <p>One issue that affects the amount of non-recyclable plastics in an area would be the lack of separation of recycling from trash. According to an <a href="https://apps.npr.org/plastics-recycling/">NPR (National Public Radio) article on plastics</a>, “We also don’t recycle as much as we could. For example, plastic bottles are a highly desirable product for recyclers, but just about a third find their way into a recycling bin.</p>
          <p>For recycled material to reach its destination its important to separate materials. Mixing different materials together which could lead to damaged machines while processing recycling, and delay the sorting process which leads to more plastic thrown away.</p>

      <div class="container">
          <h2>International recyclable value</h2>
          <p>Since January 2018, China hasn’t accepted two dozen different recycling materials, such as plastic and mixed paper, unless they meet strict rules around contamination. Imported recycling has to be clean and unmixed – a standard too hard to meet for most American cities.</p>
          <p>Another article PhillyMag.com sites, “China decided last year it would only purchase recyclables if they were virtually spotless. Anything with a contamination rate of more than 0.5 percent was suddenly no good, even though the industry standard used to be 3 percent.</p>

          <h2>Price of recycling vs. oil prices</h2>

          <p>Since recycling deal with plastic and materials, oil plays a key role on how much these non-recycled materials are worth, according to PhillyMag.com on a report saying, “The going rate for plastics, for instance, has long been linked to fuel prices worldwide: If fuel is expensive, it becomes cheaper to reuse old plastic rather than make it from scratch, and vice versa.</p>
          <p>This creates a situation when preexisting plastics and recyclable become less valuable it becomes difficult for the cities like Philadelphia to process or reuse compared to the cost of new producing the plastic.</p>
